# Introduction to R

In this lab, we will introduce the basic functionality of R, together with some simple plotting functions. We will be using the following files for these examples:

- A dataset of morphological measurements of three species of penguin from the file *penguins.csv*

More information about this dataset can be found here: [https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html)

## A quick note on formatting

In this and subsequent labs, code that can be entered into R will be high-lit, e.g.:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(x, y)
```

And R output will be formatted with `##` at the start of the line. File names will be given in *italics* and will be available in the 'data' directory on the course Canvas site. 

# Getting started

## RStudio layout

The R Studio interface consists of several windows. Start R Studio from the 'Start' menu under Windows, and the following window should appear:

![RStudio Interface](./images/rstudio.png)

- *Bottom left*: console window (also called command window). Here you can type simple commands after the `>` prompt and R will then execute your command. This is the most important window, because this is where R actually does stuff.
- *Top left*: editor window (also called script window). Collections of commands (scripts) can be edited and saved. When you don't see this window, you can open it with [File $>$ New $>$ R script]. Just typing a command in the editor window is not enough, it has to get into the command window before R executes the command. If you want to run a line from the script window (or the whole script), copy and paste it to the console. Alternatively, you can click [Run] or press CTRL+ENTER to send it to the command window.
- *Top right*: workspace / history window. In the workspace window you can see which data and values R has in its memory. You can view and edit the values by clicking on them. The history window shows what has been typed before.
- *Bottom right*: Files / plots / packages / help window. Here you can open files, view plots (also previous plots), install and load packages or use the help function. You can change the size of the windows by dragging the grey bars between the windows.

Note that you can rearrange the order of these panels, so this may look different on other computers.

## Working with R

Much of your time spent with R will involve typing commands in at the console, and R Studio has some help with this.

- The up/down arrow keys allow you to cycle back through commands that have been previously entered. You can then modify or reuse these as necessary. The commands can also be accessed through the `History' tab in the top-right panel
- The console has 'tab-completion', which allows you to enter the first few characters of a string or function name, press 'Tab', and R Studio will bring up a list of possible options that match the string you entered. Try typing `pri` and pressing 'Tab' - you should see `print` as part of the list, and you can click on this, or scroll down to use it from the list. 

## Workspace

R has a *workspace* where variables and data are stored as you use it. This is held in the memory of the computer, so if you are working from a file, you will need to read it in to the R workspace, and then work on the values held in memory. This means that you only access files to read in or write out data, the rest of the time you are working on a copy in the workspace. 

## Working directory

R defines the working directory as the folder in which it is currently working. When you ask R to open a certain file, it will look in the working directory for this file, and when you tell R to save a data file or plot, it will save it in the working directory. Once you have done this, download all the files from the training session Google drive and move them to the data folder. 

For this class, the labs will assume that you have your files organized according to the following structure:

```
+-- ugic2024
|   +-- data
```

To do this, go to your `Documents` folder, and create a new folder called `ugic2024`. In this now create a new folder called `data` (where we will store all the data used today. 

Once you have created these folders, we need to change R's working directory so that it is pointing to `ugic2024`. The easiest way to do this is by going to the [Session] menu in RStudio, then [Change working directory]. This will open a file browser that you can use to browse through your computer and find the folder. (If you are using the base version of R, go to [File] $>$ [Change dir...] in Windows, or [Misc] $>$ [Change Working Directory] in Mac.)

You can also change the working directory manually using the `setwd()` function in the console. To do this, you may need to know the full path to the folder on your computer. If you followed the instructions given above, this should be:

- On a Windows system: `C:/Users/username/Documents/ugic2024`
- On a Mac OSX system: `/Users/username/Documents/ugic2024`

Where `username` is your name on the computer. You can also find this path by 

- On a Windows system: `
    - Use the File Explorer to select the folder `ugic2024`
    - Right-click the folder and select 'Properties'
    - In the pop-up window, the path will be listed under 'Location'
    - Highlight this, and copy the path
- On a Mac OSX system: 
    - Use the Finder app to select the folder `ugic2024`
    - Go to the "View" menu then "Show Path Bar". THis will make the full path appear at the bottom of the Finder window
    - Right-click the Path Bar file name
    - Select "Copy as Pathname"
You can now run the `setwd()` command. Go to the console window in RStudio and enter the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("")
```

And paste your directory between the quotes. The code should look something like this (but with your actual user name):

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/username/Documents/ugic2024/")
```

Note that the slashes are forward slashes and don't forget the quotations.  R is case sensitive, so make sure you write capitals where necessary. To check that you have correctly changed directory, enter the following command, which will show you the current working directory:

```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

You can also use relative paths. If your current working directory is `ugic2024` and you want to change to `data`, enter the following code (where the `./` changes the directory to a level higher than the current one).

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("./data")
```

If your current working directory is `data` and you want to change to `ugic2024`, enter the following code (where the `../` changes the directory to a level below the current one).

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("../")
```

Before proceeding with the rest of today's lab, make sure to change your working directory back to `ugic2024`. 

If this all seems a little foreign to you, don't worry - there will be plenty of opportunities to practice this over the day. Understanding the directory structure is very important in being able to manage your files both for this training session and any analysis you will do later. 

## Using the console

In the console, the '`>`' is the prompt, and your commands will be entered here. Click on the console window, then enter the following:

```{r}
2+2
```

And press 'Enter', and R will tell you, not too surprisingly, that 2+2=4. The spacing is not important: you could equally enter `2 + 2` or `2+ 2` and get the same result. The `[1]` before the output is a vector index. It refers to the first value in the *output* vector (here a vector of length 1). We'll be using this later.

We can equally use standard math functions, for example, to take the natural log or square root of 2:

```{r}
log(2)
sqrt(2)
```

## Asssigning output

So far, these commands have runs some calculations and displayed the results in the console. If you need to store any R output for further use, you will need to assign to to a variable. There are two assignment operators in R `<-` and `=`. These are interchangeable, and you will see both used in R examples. To store the results of the previous commands:

```{r}
a = log(2)
b = sqrt(2)
```

If you now look in the top right corner in the 'Environment' window, you should see these two variables appear. These are now held in R's workspace and can be reused:

```{r}
a + b
```

#File input and output

R can use many different file types, but comma separated value (csv) files are most frequently used as the easiest way to transfer between R and Excel. Make sure you have changed your working directory to the `ugic2024` folder. Then get a list of csv files in the `data` folder as follows (note the use of the pattern parameter to get only certain files):

```{r}
list.files("./data/", pattern=".csv")
```

Let's read in the data from the Penguin file (*penguins.csv*, make sure this appeared in the list from the previous command and ask me if you don't see it). CSV files can be read in using the `read.csv()` function:

```{r}
penguin <- read.csv("./data/penguins.csv")
```

Note that because this file is held in a different folder (`data`) to your current working directory (`ugic2024`), you need to provide the relative path (`./data`). 

The first part of this code (`penguin <-`) tells R to store the data read in from the file in a *data frame* called `penguin`. To print out the contents of any object in R, simply type the name of that object at the command prompt.

```{r results='hide'}
penguin
```

Other useful commands are `class()` to see what data class an object is (a dataframe), and `names()` to get a list of the column headers. The function `str()` is probably the most useful, describing the column names and the type of data stored in them.

```{r results='hide'}
class(penguin)
names(penguin)
str(penguin)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
str(penguin)
```

You can write out dataframes to csv files with `write.csv()`. Here we'll write the penguin data back out to a new file (normally, we'd only do this after transforming or working with the data, but this is just an example). Once you've run this, check the `data` folder to make sure the new file has been created.

```{r}
write.csv(penguin, "./data/penguin2.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

You can also write out the entire contents of R's workspace to a binary file (`*.RData`), with the save function. This can be useful if you want to save a snapshot of your current R session with all the variables and objects you are working with. To save the current workspace:

```{r}
save(list = ls(), file = "dat.RData")
```

We can now clear the current workspace (check the environment window before and after you do this):

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

And if we now reload the binary file, you should see that the variables we had previously (`penguin`, `a`, `b`) reappear in the environment.

```{r}
load(file = "dat.RData")
```

# Data manipulation

When we read in the contents of the file, it was store as a dataframe with a variable name `penguin` - this represents the whole dataset. Normally however, you will need to work with subsets of the data (e.g. individual columns or sets of rows). There are two common ways to do this, one with base R and one using the tidyverse, that we will explore here. The tidyverse syntax is becoming more prevalent, especially for data science work, but there are still times when understanding the base R approach can be useful, e.g. when working with matrices or arrays. 

## Base R

If you want to use base R to access subsets of the data frame or individual values, you will need to understand how R indexes data. R uses a 1-based indexing, which means that the first value in any set of data will be indexed at 1, then at 2, etc. This is in contrast to some other languages (e.g. Python) that use 0-based indexing. 

### Vectors

To show how this works, we'll first create a vector of random numbers and print the content (note that your values will be different):

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
x
```

To access the first value:

```{r}
x[1]
```

Or to access the third:

```{r}
x[3]
```

You can also use the colon `:` to *slice* the data, i.e. extract the data between two indices:

```{r}
x[1:3]
```

Or you can use a set of irregular indices by concatenating them together with the `c()` function:

```{r}
x[c(3,5,7)]
```

You can also use a reverse index with a `-` symbol. This will extract all values *except* the one with that index:

```{r}
x[-1]
```

### Matrices

Matrices in R are index by `[row,col]`, so you need to provide both of these to extract subsets of data. Here we'll make up a small matrix with values from 2 to 24 on a step of 2:

```{r}
x <- matrix(seq(2, 24, by = 2), nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
```

To get the very first entry, we index it with `[1,1]`:

```{r}
x[1,1]
```

And to get the last:

```{r}
x[3,4]
```

If you only provide one index, then it will extract all values for that row/columns:

```{r}
x[1,] # first row
x[,4] # fourth column
```

As before, you can use `:` to extract slices. This will extract all values in the 2nd to 4th columns

```{r}
x[, 2:4]
```

Or the first row for the same columns:

```{r}
x[1, 2:4]
```

### Dataframes

At this point, you may be wondering how all this relates to data frames - which is how the penguin data was stored when it was read in from the csv file earlier. Data frames are similar to 2D matrices as they are composed of rows (representing observations) and columns (representing variables). As a result, you can use the same row/column indexing to access subsets of data:

```{r results='hide'}
penguin[ ,4]   # 4th column
penguin[10, ]  # 10th row
```

And as before, you can access a range of rows and columns using `:`:

```{r results='hide'}
penguin[ ,1:4]     # Columns 1 to 4
penguin[1:10, ]    # First 10 rows
penguin[1:50,1:2]  # First 50 rows of the first two columns
```

Dataframes also use a `$` notation, which allows to access individual columns or variables. For example, to extract the bill length variable:

```{r}
names(penguin)
```

```{r results='hide'}
penguin$bill_length_mm  	# Extract single column
```

The advantage of this is that you can access a column, even if you don't know wthe column number.  You can also combine this with the vector indexing (see above) to access specific values within a vector:

```{r results='hide'}
penguin$bill_length_mm[3]      # 3rd element
penguin$bill_length_mm[-3]     # All but 3rd element
penguin$bill_length_mm[1:10]   # First 10 elements
```

Logical operators $<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=$ can be used to select parts of the data set by value. This is very useful if you only want to analyze part of your dataset:

```{r results='hide'}
penguin$bill_length_mm[penguin$bill_length_mm > 40]	# All bill lengths over 40 mm
penguin[penguin$bill_length_mm > 40, ]	# All columns with bill length length over 40 
penguin$bill_length_mm[(penguin$species == 'Adelie')] 	# All "Adelie" penguins
penguin[(penguin$species == 'Adelie'), ] 	# All columns for "Adelie" penguins
```

These operators can be combined, so to get all instances of "Adelie" species with bill lengths greater than 40:

```{r results='hide'}
penguin[(penguin$species == 'Adelie') & (penguin$bill_length_mm > 40), ]
```

### Matrices vs dataframes

The main difference is that dataframes can contain different data classes, where as matrices and vectors can only contain a single class. Compare the matrix we made earlier:

```{r}
class(x)			
class(x[, 1])
class(x[, 2])
```

To the content of the dataframe

```{r}
class(penguin)			
class(penguin$bill_length_mm)		
class(penguin$species)			
```

## Data manipulation with the tidyverse

The tidyverse is a set of add-on packages for R that are largely designed to streamline working with and visualizing data in R. One of these packages (**dplyr**) is used to transform and summarize tabular data with rows and columns, like R's dataframes. It can be used as a replacement for much of the indexing described above. The package contains a set of functions (or "verbs") that perform common data manipulation operations such as filtering for rows, selecting specific columns, re-ordering rows, adding new columns and summarizing data.

As this is an add-on package, you will need to download and install it. YOu can install the entire set of tidyverse packages with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Or just **dplyr** with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Note that you will only need to install this once, but each time you want to use it in a new R session, you will need to load it into memory using the `library` function: 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

**dplyr** has a wide variety of operations, but the most important ones are:

| Verb | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `select()` |	select columns |
| `filter()`	| filter rows | 
| `arrange()`	| re-order or arrange rows |
| `mutate()` | create new columns |
| `summarise()` | summarize values |
| `group_by()` | allows for group operations | 

These functions are commonly used with a pipe operator, which can be used to chain functions together. This is loaded automatically with **dplyr** so you don't need to worry about loading it. The pipe operator is written as `%>%` (or `|>`), and takes the output from one function and *pipes* it directly to another function. In the first example below, we'll look at using one of these functions without and then with the pipe, and then use the pipe throughout the rest of this lab. 

### Selecting by column

The `select()` function allows the selection of columns by name. To use this without the pipe, add the data frame name in the function parentheses. Here we select two columns from the `penguin` dataframe, and then use the head function to show the first few rows. 

```{r}
spp_yr <- select(penguin, species, year)
head(spp_yr) # Show the first 6 rows
```

We can rewrite this as a single line using the `%>%` pipe and avoiding the need for the intermediate data frame `spp_yr`. Note there are two pipes: the first sends the dataframe to the `select()` function, and the second sends the output of this function to the `head()` function:

```{r}
penguin %>% 
  select(species, year) %>% 
  head()
```

For most of these examples, we won't save the output, but you can easily store this by assigning it to a new variable:

```{r}
spp_yr <- penguin %>% 
  select(species, year) 
```

To select all the columns except a specific column, use the "-" (subtraction) operator:

```{r results='hide'}
penguin %>% 
  select(-year) %>% 
  head()
```

To select a range of columns by name, use the "`:`" (colon) operator (as we did with selecting multiple columns using indices)

```{r results='hide'}
penguin %>% 
  select(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g) %>%
  head()
```

To select all columns that start with the character string "`bill`", use the function `starts_with()`

```{r results='hide'}
penguin %>%
  select(starts_with("bill"))
```

Here are some additional functions to select columns based on a specific criteria:

- `ends_with()` = Select columns that end with a character string
- `contains()` = Select columns that contain a character string
- `matches()` = Select columns that match a regular expression
- `one_of()` = Select columns names that are from a group of names

### Filtering by row

The `filter()` function allows the selection of rows. To filter the data for rows where the body mass is over 4000 grams:

```{r results='hide'}
penguin %>% 
  filter(body_mass_g > 65)
```

You can add mulitple conditions in the filter function. For example, to filter for male penguins with a body mass of over 4000 g:

```{r results='hide'}
penguin %>%
  filter(sex == "male", body_mass_g > 4000)
```

To filter for male penguins with a body mass of over 4000 g, and are from Torgensen island: 

```{r results='hide'}
penguin %>%
  filter(sex == "male", body_mass_g > 4000, island == "Biscoe")
```

Filter for female penguins from Biscoe and Torgensen islands
```{r results='hide'}
penguin %>%
  filter(sex == "female", island %in% c("Biscoe","Torgensen"))
```

Note that there is also a `slice()` function, which simply extracts rows according to their position - this is the equivalent to the indexing we have done before:

```{r}
penguin %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

## The `arrange()` function

This function allows us to arrange (or re-order) rows by a particular column. So to arrange by increasing life expectancy (I'm using the `head()` function to limit the amount of data that appears on the screen): 

```{r}
penguin %>% 
  arrange(bill_length_mm) %>% 
  head()
```

And you can include the `desc()` function to reverse the sort order:

```{r}
penguin %>% 
  arrange(desc(bill_length_mm)) %>% 
  head()
```

Note that you can add additional variable names to `arrange()` to sort on consecutive columns. 

## Using multiple functions

The real power of **dplyr** comes when you start 

Now, we will select four columns from the dataset, arrange the rows by the life expectancy then pass this to `head()` to show the first few rows:

```{r results='hide'}
gap %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>%
  arrange(lifeExp) %>%
  head()
```

Now do the same, but only filter for the year 2002

```{r results='hide'}
gap %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  arrange(lifeExp) %>%
  head()
```

Or to do the same, but ordered by GDP:
```{r results='hide'}
gap %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  arrange(gdpPercap) %>%
  head()
```

Repeat this, but sort the GDP in descending order. For this, we can use the function `desc()`:

```{r results='hide'}
gap %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%
  head()
```

## Factors 

The vector of species names (`penguin$species`) is a set of character strings. R has another data type, a **factor** used to represent groups within your data. With a factor, R automatically assumes that every observation with the same name or *level* belongs to a single group, which can greatly facilitate comparing values between groups 

You can convert a vector of character strings to a factor with the `as.factor()` function. The following code replaces the original `species` string with factor:

```{r}
penguin$species <- as.factor(penguin$species)
```

Now let's recheck the class:

```{r}
class(penguin$species)
```

If we now check the first 10 values, you will see some additional information showing the levels of the factor, i.e. the individual groups. 

```{r}
penguin$species[1:10]
```

R automatically sets the levels in alphabetical order, irrespective of the order in the vector. The first level is considered to be the reference level, which has some uses in regression model as we will see later. You can change the order of the levels using the `factor()` function. The following sets the species `Gentoo` as the reference:

```{r eval=FALSE}
factor(penguin$species, levels = c("Gentoo", "Chinstrap", "Adelie"))
```

We will look further at how factors work in a later lab. 

# Functions in R

Functions typically are comprised of the name of the function (`sqrt` for taking square roots) and a set of parentheses. The parentheses are used to pass data to the function as well as setting parameters to change the behavior of the function.

```{r}
sqrt(5)
```

Note that we can use the assignment operator to save the output from a function, allowing you to use this in subsequent functions and analyses. 
```{r}
y <- sqrt(5)
round(y)
```

To save time and code, functions can be combined:
```{r}
round(sqrt(5))
```

The `seq()` function produces a series of numbers on a regular step. By default, it require 3 parameters, the starting number, the ending number and the step.
```{r}
seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = 2)
```

If you include the parameter names, as in this example, the order does not matter. The parameter names can be omitted if you keep to the specified order of parameters. So `seq(0,20,2)` will give you the equivalent results.

To find out what these parameters are, what they are called and what values they take, use the `help()` function, e.g. `help(seq)`. This will open a window with the help file for that function. If you do not know the name of a function, there is a search function `help.search()`, or use the help browser `help.start()`, browse to packages or use the search engine.

## Univariate statistics

Now create two new vectors in R containing the list of bill lengths and the list of species names. Note the use of the assignment operator `<-`. You can also use the equal sign  (`=`) here and elsewhere in these examples.

```{r}
bl <- penguin$bill_length_mm
sp <- penguin$species
```

R has a large number of inbuilt functions. This section is designed to simply introduce you to the some basic functions for describing data. We'll start by simply calculating the mean of the bill length values

```{r}
mean(bl)
```

This returns the value `NA`, rather than a mean length. So what went wrong? In the original set of data, there are some missing values, also denoted by `NA`. 

```{r}
bl[1:15]
```

R's default for most functions is to not calculate values when there are missing observations. This is really to alert you to the fact that the data are incomplete, and the value you would obtain might be biased. You can overrule this by adding the argument `na.rm=TRUE` to the following functions. This removes `NA`s and calculates the value with whatever is leftover.

Functions to describe the central tendency:
```{r}
mean(bl, na.rm = TRUE)
median(bl, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Functions to describe the dispersion (output not shown):
```{r results='hide'}
sd(bl, na.rm = TRUE)
var(bl, na.rm = TRUE)
min(bl, na.rm = TRUE)
max(bl, na.rm = TRUE)
quantile(bl, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Note that `quantile()` takes a parameter that allows you to choose the quantile to be calculated, e.g. `quantile(bl, c(0.1,0.9), na.rm = TRUE)`, will calculate the 10th and 90th percentile. Try adapting this to calculate the 25th and 75th percentile.

Some other useful functions:
```{r results='hide'}
sum(bl, na.rm = TRUE)
summary(bl)
```

Note that we do not need to tell R to exclude `NA`s for the `summary()` function. This provides a set of summary statistics *and* lets you know how many values are missing. 

Some specific functions for categorical data
```{r results='hide'}
levels(sp)
table(sp)
```

As R is object oriented, functions will adapt to different data types
```{r results='hide'}
summary(bl) ## Summary of numeric vector
summary(sp) ## Summary of categorical vector
summary(penguin) ## Summary of data frame
```

### The `tapply()` function

R has a set of `*apply` functions designed to help to do repetitive tasks. We will look at one of the simplest of these today, the `table` apply function. This *applies* a function (e.g. mean) to a vector, but calculates the function on subgroups defined by categories in a second vector. For example, to calculate the average bill length per species of penguin, we can do the following:
```{r}
tapply(penguin$bill_length_mm, penguin$species, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Repeat this and calculate the standard deviation per species. 



# Basic plotting in R

We'll now look quickly at the basic plotting functions in R. R has a wide range of plotting types, and we will look at some more complex methods later in this class. For now, we will concentrate on the basic plotting function (`plot()`) and how to simply modify this.

## Index plots

The simplest type of plot is an index plot, which simply plots values in the order they are recorded in the input vector. These are useful for examining the basic data structure and identifying errors and outliers. `plot` is a generic plotting command and will adapt to different data types. The parameter `type='p'` gives the plot type, here using points. Other options are `'l'` for lines, `'h'` for histogram lines, `'s'` for a stepped plot and `'b'` for both line and points. See `help(plot)` for more options and other parameters. 

```{r}
plot(penguin$bill_length_mm, type = 'p')
```

As we have only asked to plot one variable, this is represented on the y-axis. The x-axis gives the index of the observation, in this case from 1 to 350. Other index plots include strip plots and dot plots (also known as Cleveland plots). Here we use a combination of species name and row number to label the plot.

```{r}
stripchart(penguin$bill_length_mm, method = 'stack')

dotchart(penguin$bill_length_mm[1:20], 
         labels = paste(penguin$species[1:20], 1:20, sep = "_"))
```

The final example of an index plot shown in class is the quantile-quantile or q-q plot. This compares the quantiles of the set of data values to equivalent quantiles from a standard normal distribution. The first function used here `qqnorm()` plots this comparison, and if the data set is normally distributed, there should be a linear correspondence between the observed and theoretical quantiles, i.e. they should form a straight line on the scatterplot. The second function, `qqline`, adds a line representing the match between two normal distributions. If the points from the first function fall mainly on this line, we can infer that our data set is close to being normally distributed. 

```{r}
qqnorm(penguin$bill_length_mm)
qqline(penguin$bill_length_mm)
```

## Summary plots 

Summary plots attempt to describe the distribution of the data, giving some ideas about which values are most common and which are most rare. Histograms are commonly used for this method, values are 'binned' into a set of classes, and the histogram represents the frequency of occurrences in that bin. Bins are defined with the `breaks` parameter, which may be set to a constant number in which case the data range is split into that many bins, or as a sequence of numbers defining the intervals between bins. In this latter case, we can make use of the `seq()` function from earlier. 

```{r}
hist(penguin$bill_length_mm, breaks = 20)
hist(penguin$bill_length_mm, breaks = seq(30, 60, 2.5))
```

An alternative to histograms are boxplots, which show information about the data quartiles.
Here the box represents the interquartile data (25-75\% of the data), the thick bar is the median, and the 'whiskers' show the data range.

```{r}
boxplot(penguin$bill_length_mm)
```

This is not hugely informative, but we will expand this plot below:

## Bivariate plots

Bivariate plots are designed to show the relationship between two variables, and how this may vary. The simplest form is the scatter plot. We use the `plot()` function again, but now we give it two variables (x and y). 

```{r}
plot(penguin$bill_length_mm, penguin$bill_depth_mm)
```

As we know that these values come from three difference species, we can use this knowledge
to add extra information to the plot, by using the `col` parameter. We first convert the `Species` vector to a factor class. R will then use the levels of the factor to assign colors to the points. We can also change the symbol type using the `pch` parameter.

```{r}
penguin$species <- as.factor(penguin$species)

plot(penguin$bill_length_mm, penguin$bill_depth_mm,
     col = penguin$species, pch = 16)
```

Let's clean up this plot a little by specifying the axis labels and a title:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(penguin$bill_length_mm, penguin$bill_depth_mm,
     col = penguin$species, 
     pch = 16, 
     xlab = "Bill length (mm)", 
     ylab = "Bill depth (mm)",
     main = "Penguin size measurements (Palmer Archipelago)")
```

We can also add a legend to our plot to explain the different colors and symbols. Unfortunately, R makes you do all the work for this, using the `legend()` function. Here, we add a legend to the top left of the plot, giving the labels for each color and the color used:

```{r eval=FALSE}
legend("bottomleft",
       legend = c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo"),
       col = c(1,2,3), 
       pch = 16)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(penguin$bill_length_mm, penguin$bill_depth_mm,
     col = penguin$species, 
     pch = 16, 
     xlab = "Bill length (mm)", 
     ylab = "Bill depth (mm)",
     main = "Penguin size measurements (Palmer Archipelago)")
legend("bottomleft",
       legend = c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo"),
       col = c(1,2,3), 
       pch = 16)
```
Note that we can also use the `levels()` function introduced above to help - this will give us the list of labels to be used in the title:

An alternative way to look at the association between factors and a variable is, again, to use boxplots. Note that this code uses a tilde ($\sim$) between the variable and the set of factors. The tilde is often used to define dependency between two variables, and we will return to this again during the modeling part of this class. 

```{r}
boxplot(penguin$bill_length_mm ~ penguin$species, 
        ylab = 'Bill length (mm)')
```

As the boxplot does not automatically label the y-axis, we add this with the `ylab` parameter. See `help(plot)` and `help(par)` for a complete list of the plotting parameters. 

## Graphic output

By default, R plots graphics to the screen, but has the ability to save figures in most of the standard graphic formats. In order to do this, you first need to open a file (a graphics *device*), then run the plotting functions, then close the device. Remember that you need to plot all the layers of a figure before closing the file. The following example plots the penguin bill length data to a pdf file. Alternatives include: png, jpeg, svg, etc.; type `help(Devices)` for more details. 

```{r results='hide', eval=FALSE}
pdf("penguin_bill_length.pdf")
plot(penguin$bill_length_mm, penguin$bill_depth_mm,
     col = penguin$species, 
     pch = 16, 
     xlab = "Bill length (mm)", 
     ylab = "Bill depth (mm)",
     main = "Penguin size measurements (Palmer Archipelago")
legend("bottomleft",
       legend = c("Adelie","Chinstrap","Gentoo"),
       col = c(1,2,3), 
       pch = 16)
dev.off()
```

Alternatively, you can copy-paste directly into Word by going to [Export] -> [Copy to clipboard...] in R Studio's plotting window.


# Quitting R

When you are finished with R, exit by typing `q()` in the console (or going to [File] $>$ [Quit R Studio]). You will be asked if you want to save your workspace. This is generally a good idea, as this will create a file containing all your current data (".RData"), and the history (".Rhistory") of the commands you have used. If you restart R in the same directory, by clicking on an R script file, the workspace will be loaded automatically. If it doesn't, you can load this by changing to the the correct working directory and typing:

```{r eval=FALSE}
load(".RData")
```



# Where to get help


Working in R can be frustrating, with errors and warnings popping up from you know not where. In fact, problems arise so often, troubleshooting (which usually just means Googling) should be considered an inescapable component of programming.
